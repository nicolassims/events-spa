Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
 Nicolas Karayakaylar

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
 https://github.com/nicolassims/events-spa/

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?
 I was unable to deploy.

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
 My app is missing the ability to add comments and reactions to events.

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
 The app is not, as previously said, deployed. There were many, *many,* errors that halted the process, but the last one, while still attempting to deploy the server, was an endless hang on start.sh, similar to the problem described [here](https://piazza.com/class/kjvwd1w79kl1na?cid=354), and elsewhere.

And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
 - Development
 - Deployment
 - Submission
